Metaheuristics methods
===========================

1. Description
--------------

This repo contains the code to study the behaviour of a set of basic metaheuristics methods:

* Simulated annealing
* Tabu search
* Genetic algorithm
* Particle swarm optimization
* Multiobjective problem

The algorithms are implemented in Python and they are modificated from some sources around the web (see acknowledgments).

The tests are implemented using IPython to have more interaction to see how the results change when we tune the parameters of each algorithm.

Also, you can find the presentation of the study itself in the folder called "Presentation".

This study is included within the module 3 of the Data science masters of the University of Seville.
